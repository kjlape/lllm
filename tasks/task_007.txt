# Task ID: 7
# Title: Configure OpenWebUI with SQLite Backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up OpenWebUI with a SQLite backend for persistent storage of user data and conversations.
# Details:
Configure the OpenWebUI container to use SQLite for persistent storage. Ensure the database file is stored in a mounted volume to persist across container restarts and redeployments. Configure environment variables in the Docker Compose file to specify the database location and other OpenWebUI settings. Verify that user conversations and settings are preserved across container restarts.

# Test Strategy:
Create test conversations and settings in OpenWebUI, then restart the container to verify persistence. Check that the SQLite database is being properly saved to the mounted volume. Verify database integrity after multiple restarts.
