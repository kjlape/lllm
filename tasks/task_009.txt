# Description: Configure personal workspaces in OpenWebUI for retrieval-augmented generation and context organization.
# Details:
Set up and configure workspaces in OpenWebUI for different use cases. For each workspace: 1) Configure appropriate settings for the intended use case, 2) Set up folders or categories for organizing conversations, 3) Configure retrieval-augmented generation features if available, 4) Test context retention within and between conversations. Document the workspace structure and provide examples of effective organization for different types of tasks.

# Test Strategy:
Create test workspaces for different scenarios (e.g., coding, writing, research). Test the organization features and verify that context is properly maintained within workspaces. Test retrieval capabilities by referencing information from previous conversations.
