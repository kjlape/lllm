# Task ID: 8
# Title: Enable Voice Chat Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure and test voice chat capabilities in OpenWebUI for speech-to-text and text-to-speech interaction.
# Details:
Enable voice chat functionality in OpenWebUI by configuring the appropriate settings. This may involve: 1) Enabling built-in voice features in OpenWebUI, 2) Configuring any necessary environment variables in the Docker Compose file, 3) Testing both speech-to-text (user input) and text-to-speech (AI responses) functionality, 4) Optimizing voice quality and responsiveness. Document any limitations or requirements for using voice features.

# Test Strategy:
Test voice input and output functionality through the OpenWebUI interface. Verify that speech recognition works correctly and that text-to-speech output is clear and natural. Test with different browsers and devices on the local network.
