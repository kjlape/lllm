# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Remote Deployment Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the local CLI tool, remote installation script, and Docker Compose configuration to create a seamless deployment workflow.
# Details:
Enhance the local CLI tool to handle the complete deployment workflow: 1) Copying necessary files to the remote server, 2) Executing the installation script if needed, 3) Deploying the Docker Compose configuration, 4) Verifying services are running properly. Add a new command 'deploy:setup' that performs the complete initial setup and deployment in one step. Ensure the tool provides clear feedback throughout the process and handles errors gracefully.

# Test Strategy:
Test the complete deployment workflow on a clean Ubuntu server. Verify that the workflow can be executed with a single command and results in a working deployment. Test error scenarios such as network interruptions or insufficient server resources.
