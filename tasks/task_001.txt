# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create Local Deployment CLI Tool
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a bash script that enables single-command deployment from a local machine to a remote server, following the Kamal-like deployment experience.
# Details:
Start with the provided CLI example in the appendix. Implement all required functions: setup, deploy, status, logs, and ssh. Add proper error handling, command-line argument validation, and clear output messages. The script should handle SSH connectivity to the remote server and include configuration variables for server host, deployment directory, and other customizable parameters. Make sure the script is executable and properly documented.

# Test Strategy:
Test each function individually with a test server. Verify SSH connectivity, proper command execution, and error handling when the server is unreachable or commands fail.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core CLI Structure with Configuration Management [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundation of the bash script with command parsing, help documentation, and configuration management for deployment parameters.
### Details:
1. Create a new bash script file with proper shebang (#!/bin/bash)
2. Implement configuration management to store and retrieve server host, deployment directory, and other parameters
3. Create a function to parse command-line arguments and route to appropriate functions
4. Implement the help command to display usage instructions
5. Add basic error handling for invalid commands and missing arguments
6. Create configuration file structure (.env or config.yml) to store deployment variables
7. Implement validation for required configuration variables
8. Add utility functions for colorized output messages
9. Make the script executable (chmod +x)
10. Test the basic CLI structure by running help command and checking for proper output
11. Document the configuration options and basic usage in a README.md file

## 2. Implement Core Deployment Functions [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Develop the primary deployment functions: setup, deploy, and ssh commands that handle remote server connectivity and deployment tasks.
### Details:
1. Implement the 'setup' function to initialize the remote server environment
   - Add SSH connectivity check to verify server access
   - Create necessary directories on the remote server
   - Set up any required dependencies on the remote server
2. Implement the 'deploy' function for application deployment
   - Add file transfer functionality using rsync or scp
   - Include deployment steps (stopping services, copying files, restarting services)
   - Add rollback capability in case of deployment failure
3. Implement the 'ssh' function to provide direct shell access to the server
   - Create a wrapper around the SSH command with proper authentication
   - Add support for executing specific commands remotely
4. Add proper error handling for network issues and remote execution failures
5. Implement progress indicators for long-running operations
6. Test each function with minimal configuration to ensure proper connectivity
7. Document each function's parameters and behavior

## 3. Implement Monitoring and Logging Functions with Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Complete the CLI tool by adding status and logs commands, finalizing documentation, and adding comprehensive error handling and validation.
### Details:
1. Implement the 'status' function to check deployment status
   - Add remote service status checking
   - Display uptime and health information
   - Implement formatted output for status information
2. Implement the 'logs' function to view application logs
   - Add functionality to stream logs from remote server
   - Include options for filtering logs (tail, grep, etc.)
   - Support following logs in real-time
3. Enhance error handling across all functions
   - Add detailed error messages with troubleshooting hints
   - Implement proper exit codes for different error scenarios
4. Add comprehensive validation for all command-line arguments
5. Create detailed documentation with examples for each command
6. Add a version command to display the tool version
7. Implement unit tests for critical functions
8. Create integration tests for end-to-end deployment scenarios
9. Add a command completion script for bash/zsh
10. Finalize the README with complete usage instructions, configuration options, and troubleshooting tips
