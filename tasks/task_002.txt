# Task ID: 2
# Title: Create Remote Installation Script for Docker and NVIDIA Container Toolkit
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a bash script that installs Docker, Docker Compose, and NVIDIA Container Toolkit on the remote Ubuntu server.
# Details:
Start with the provided installation script in the appendix. Enhance it with better error handling and verification steps. The script should check if components are already installed before attempting installation. Add verification steps to confirm Docker is running properly, the user has been added to the docker group, and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is correctly configured. Include a simple test to verify GPU passthrough functionality using a basic container like nvidia/cuda:11.0-base with nvidia-smi command.

# Test Strategy:
Run the script on a clean Ubuntu system and verify that all components are installed correctly. Test Docker functionality by running a simple container. Verify GPU passthrough by running a container with nvidia-smi command.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement prerequisite checks and environment validation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create initial script section that checks system requirements, validates Ubuntu version, and determines if components are already installed before proceeding with installation
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create the script header with proper shebang and script metadata
2. Implement functions to check Ubuntu version compatibility
3. Create functions to detect if Docker, Docker Compose, and NVIDIA Container Toolkit are already installed
4. Add GPU detection to verify NVIDIA hardware is present
5. Implement comprehensive logging functionality
6. Add command-line parameters for options like force reinstall and verbose output
7. Testing approach: Run on systems with and without components installed to verify proper detection

## 2. Develop Docker installation with error handling [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create the Docker installation section with proper error handling, rollback capabilities, and verification steps
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a function to install Docker using official repository method
2. Implement error handling for each installation step (apt update, key import, repository addition, installation)
3. Add verification to confirm Docker daemon is running properly after installation
4. Implement user addition to the docker group with verification
5. Create rollback functionality to revert changes if installation fails
6. Add proper exit codes for different failure scenarios
7. Testing approach: Test installation on clean system and verify Docker runs with 'docker run hello-world'

## 3. Implement Docker Compose installation module [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create the Docker Compose installation section with version detection, binary installation, and permission setting
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a function to detect latest stable Docker Compose version
2. Implement download and installation of Docker Compose binary to /usr/local/bin
3. Add proper permission setting for the binary
4. Implement verification that Docker Compose works correctly
5. Add error handling for network issues during download
6. Implement version comparison if Docker Compose is already installed
7. Testing approach: Verify Docker Compose installation with 'docker-compose version' and test a simple compose file

## 4. Develop NVIDIA Container Toolkit installation with validation [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create the NVIDIA Container Toolkit installation section with dependency checking, proper repository setup, and configuration validation
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement NVIDIA driver detection and version compatibility check
2. Create function to add NVIDIA Container Toolkit repository
3. Implement installation of nvidia-container-toolkit package
4. Add Docker daemon configuration for NVIDIA runtime
5. Implement Docker service restart with failure detection
6. Create validation that NVIDIA runtime is properly configured
7. Testing approach: Check configuration files and verify runtime is listed in 'docker info'

## 5. Implement GPU passthrough testing and final verification [done]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Create comprehensive testing section that verifies GPU passthrough functionality with a test container and provides final installation report
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement function to pull nvidia/cuda:11.0-base test container
2. Create test that runs nvidia-smi inside the container to verify GPU access
3. Implement parsing of nvidia-smi output to confirm proper functionality
4. Add comprehensive final verification that checks all components are working together
5. Create detailed installation report showing versions and status of all components
6. Implement cleanup of test containers and temporary files
7. Testing approach: Verify full GPU passthrough works by running container with nvidia-smi and checking for expected GPU information
