# Overview  
This project aims to deploy OpenWebUI with a custom Ollama setup using Kamal deployment tool. The solution addresses the need for a unified interface to interact with various local and cloud-hosted LLMs while leveraging GPU acceleration for optimal performance. This personal deployment will serve as a compatibility layer to share context between different LLMs for work-related tasks.

# Core Features  
- OpenWebUI deployment with Kamal for easy management
- Custom Ollama setup with GPU acceleration via hook scripts
- Multiple LLM model support (Llama3, Phi3-mini, Deepseek)
- Voice chat capabilities
- Workspace organization for retrieval-augmented generation
- Context sharing between different LLMs

# User Experience  
- Personal use with potential family access on local network
- Voice and text interaction options
- Organized workspaces for different use cases
- Seamless switching between local and cloud LLMs
- No need for external authentication in MVP (behind firewall)

# Risks and Mitigations  
1. Technical Challenges
   - Risk: GPU passthrough configuration issues in Docker
     - Mitigation: Prepare alternative Docker run commands with different GPU flags
     - Mitigation: Test incrementally with simple models before larger ones
   
   - Risk: Memory limitations with larger models like Deepseek
     - Mitigation: Implement appropriate quantization levels
     - Mitigation: Configure Ollama to efficiently manage VRAM usage

2. MVP Scope
   - Risk: Feature creep extending development time
     - Mitigation: Focus on core deployment and basic model functionality first
     - Mitigation: Document enhancement ideas for post-MVP phases
   
   - Risk: Performance expectations vs. hardware capabilities
     - Mitigation: Start with well-optimized models (Llama3 7B Q4 KM, Phi3-mini)
     - Mitigation: Benchmark different quantization levels for optimal performance

3. Resource Constraints
   - Risk: GPU memory limitations (8GB VRAM)
     - Mitigation: Prioritize models known to work well within 8GB VRAM
     - Mitigation: Use appropriate quantization (Q4) for larger models
   
   - Risk: Disk space for multiple large models
     - Mitigation: Implement model rotation strategy if needed
     - Mitigation: Monitor disk usage and clean unused model files

# Appendix  
- Technical Specifications
  - Kamal Hook Script Examples:
    ```bash
    # Example after_deploy hook for Ollama setup
    #!/bin/bash
    docker run -d --gpus all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
    
    # Example boot hook for Ollama restart
    #!/bin/bash
    docker start ollama || docker run -d --gpus all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
    ```
  
  - Recommended Models for RTX 3070 (8GB VRAM):
    - Llama3 7B Q4 KM: Good balance of performance and quality
    - Phi3-mini: Fast responses, lower resource usage
    - Deepseek (quantized): For complex reasoning tasks
  
  - Memory Usage Estimates:
    - Llama3 7B Q4: ~4GB VRAM
    - Phi3-mini: ~2GB VRAM
    - Deepseek (depending on size and quantization): 5-7GB VRAM
